What Folders to Keep for Your Quiz Project:

    assets/:
        Keep this for static assets like quiz images, icons, and global SCSS files.

    components/:
        Essential folder. You’ll have components for quiz features (QuizQuestion.vue, QuizResult.vue) and multiplayer functionality (PlayerList.vue, ChatBox.vue).

    views/:
        Keep this for the main pages of your app, such as Home.vue, Quiz.vue, Multiplayer.vue, and Results.vue.

    router/:
        Keep this for Vue Router setup to manage navigation between pages (quiz, multiplayer, results).

    store/:
        Necessary for state management (using Vuex or Pinia) to handle quiz data, multiplayer state, etc.

    services/:
        This is where you’ll put the logic for interacting with your Django REST API (e.g., fetching quiz questions, submitting results, handling multiplayer scores).

    composables/ (if using Vue 3):
        Use this for reusable logic with the Composition API. You’ll likely need this for quiz-related logic (like fetching questions) and multiplayer logic (like handling WebSocket communication).

    plugins/:
        Keep this if you plan on using third-party libraries or WebSocket configuration for real-time multiplayer features.

    directives/:
        Optional, but useful if you plan to use custom Vue directives (like detecting outside clicks for modals or UI interactions).

What to Delete (if unused):

    If you're not using directives/, plugins/, or composables/ (for example, if you don't use WebSockets or the Composition API), you can delete these folders.

Additional Suggestions:

    WebSocket/Real-Time Setup: Since it’s a multiplayer quiz, consider using WebSockets (or a service like Django Channels) for real-time communication between players.
    API Services: Structure your API calls (quizService.js, multiplayerService.js) to keep your quiz logic clean and separated from the UI.
